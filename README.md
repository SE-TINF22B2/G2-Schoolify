<p align="center">This is <b>Schoolify</b>, an all in one organizer for schools</p>

Schoolify is a web-based school planner that solves the problem of lack of organisation in everyday school life. Many students and teachers find it difficult to keep track of timetables, grades, homework and exam dates. This often leads to stress, mistakes and inefficient use of resources.

The documentation can be found in our [Wiki](https://github.com/SE-TINF22B2/G2-Schoolify/wiki/). It contains all the important information about our project and the functions it contains.

Even more specific function descriptions can be found in the [User Stories](https://github.com/SE-TINF22B2/G2-Schoolify/discussions/categories/user-stories).

To stay up to date, we provide weekly [status reports](https://github.com/SE-TINF22B2/G2-Schoolify/discussions/categories/status-berichte) in the Discussions.
